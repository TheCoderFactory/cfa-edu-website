    h5 SUPPLY CAN’T KEEP UP WITH DEMAND

    .border-secondary.hidden-sm-down
    p Now is the perfect time to start a career as a web developer. There are almost 5 jobs for every 1 developer.
    p It's safe to say that Australian companies do not want to see jobs going overseas, but if our graduates can't keep up with their Silicon Valley counterparts, then it's inevitable we'll see more entrepreneurs either starting their software companies in Silicon Valley or hiring the majority of their software developers outside Australia.
    p In the US, there will be 1 MILLION more software developer jobs than computer science graduates by 2020. Computer programming jobs are growing at 2x the national average. In Australia, unis can’t churn out CS grads fast enough to meet industry demand.
    p From startups to Fortune 100 companies, there is consistent demand for developers who write high-quality code, and experienced problem solvers who design creative solutions. Bottom line is: every company nowadays needs a developer like you!

    h5 BOOTCAMP GRADS vs COMPUTER SCIENCE GRADS

    p Become an expert on what’s currently in-demand in the software development job market.
    p Unlike a CS degree, bootcamps focus on real-world experience, and less on unnecessary theoretical jargon. Our course is faster and more cost-effective than university courses, especially with the option to access VET Student Loans.

    p Most australian universities are not producing workplace-ready engineers. Find comfort in knowing our intensive bootcamp course teaches the right languages, methodologies, processes, and problem solving concepts that the industry currently demands.

    p Our project-based course is too applied, hands-on, and small-bite to fit easily into the traditional university curriculum. Working 40 hours a week in an immersive environment, bootcamp students cover a semester’s worth of material in only four days. Think of our program as a place where technology outruns education.
