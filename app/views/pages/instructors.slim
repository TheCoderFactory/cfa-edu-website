        p Our instructors may come from different backgrounds and countries. But, they all share one trait: expertise. Our educators have a deep passion for all things technology and coding, and bring a wealth of industry experience to the classroom. This works to ensure our students learn the most in-demand programming skills. In addition, our teaching approach is far more immersive, hands-on, and collaborative than the traditional university model. Your success is our educator's success, which is why they devote time outside of teaching hours to help you become the best Junior Web Developer you can be.
